## Language Policy

All communications in this repository must be in English, including code, comments, documentation, commit messages, issues, and pull requests.

### Why English?

- **Global Accessibility**: Contributors from all regions can collaborate effectively
- **Consistency**: A single language keeps discussions organized and searchable
- **Open Source Best Practice**: Most successful open-source projects use English as the lingua franca

### Need Help with English?

If English isn't your first language, don't worry! We value your contributions regardless of perfect grammar. You can:

- Use translation tools to help compose messages
- Ask for help from other community members
- Focus on clear, simple communication rather than perfect prose

## Code Review Checklist

### Security & Safety

- [ ] No user data leakage risks or server security vulnerabilities
- [ ] No data loss risks (accidental deletion of data/files/code)
- [ ] No path traversal vulnerabilities - use `canonicalize` or strict filtering for all file path operations
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs (passwords, JWT tokens, private keys)
- [ ] No SQL injection - avoid string concatenation for raw SQL
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities in frontend code

### Rust Standards

- [ ] **Zero `.unwrap()` / `.expect()`** - Use `?` operator or `match` for error propagation
- [ ] **Clippy compliance** - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass with zero warnings
- [ ] **Code formatting** - `cargo fmt` must pass
- [ ] **Single file < 500 lines** - Files > 800 lines need splitting; > 1000 lines mandatory split
- [ ] **No `mut` without justification** - Prefer immutable by default
- [ ] **Minimize `.clone()`** - Consider references, `Cow`, `Arc` before cloning
- [ ] **Use iterator chains** - Prefer `map`, `filter`, `collect` over manual loops
- [ ] **No blocking in async** - Use `spawn_blocking` for CPU-intensive operations
- [ ] **Timeout for spawn** - All `tokio::spawn` tasks must include timeout (default 24h), except permanent background services

### Async & Concurrency

- [ ] Use `RwLock` for read-heavy concurrent access, `Mutex` for exclusive write
- [ ] No sync I/O or `thread::sleep` in async context
- [ ] Check for deadlock risks with locks
- [ ] Verify `Send` and `Sync` constraints are correct
- [ ] Check file descriptor and connection pool exhaustion in high-concurrency scenarios

### Database Operations

- [ ] Use SeaORM Query Builder - no `raw_sql`
- [ ] Table prefix: `yh_`
- [ ] No N+1 queries - avoid SQL in loops
- [ ] Index high-frequency query fields
- [ ] Minimize transaction scope to reduce lock contention
- [ ] Support both PostgreSQL and SQLite
- [ ] Auto-create tables if not exist on startup

### API & Web

- [ ] RESTful paths with `utoipa` annotations
- [ ] Return `Result<impl IntoResponse, AppError>`
- [ ] Admin endpoints start with `/admin/`
- [ ] DTO fields match `utoipa` schema descriptions
- [ ] Extraction order: `(Method, Header, State, Path, Query, Json)`

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- [ ] **Zero `any` types** - Use `bun run gen-api` for auto-generated types
- [ ] **Type check** - `bun run check` must pass with zero errors and warnings
- [ ] **Format** - `bun run format` must pass
- [ ] Use `openapi-fetch` from `src/lib/api.ts`
- [ ] All `t('key')` must exist in all language files
- [ ] Modals close on `Esc` key
- [ ] Minimum sizes: font ≥ 14px, button ≥ 32px height, clickable icons ≥ 24px

### Configuration

- [ ] **No environment variables** - All config from config files only
- [ ] Config struct 100% matches `{config-date}/config.toml`
- [ ] No hardcoded paths - use `{APPDATADIR}` placeholder
- [ ] Module business params in module's `config.rs`

### File Manager Specific

- [ ] All file operations through VFS abstraction layer
- [ ] Index refresh: single queue, user requests have highest priority
- [ ] WebDAV: RFC4918 compliant (PROPPATCH returns 403 Forbidden - acceptable)
- [ ] SFTP: Support username/password + certificate auth
- [ ] S3: AWS Signature V4 verification required
